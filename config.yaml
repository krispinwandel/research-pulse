# User Profile (Strict Methodology Focus)
interests: |
  I am a researcher focused on **Foundational Computer Vision** and **Geometric Deep Learning**.
  
  CORE INTERESTS (Select these):
  - **Current Research**: SE(3) Object Pose Estimation, Geometric Shape Priors (SemAlign3D etc.)
  - **Foundational Vision:** Self-supervised learning (DINOv3, MAE, I-JEPA), robust image representations, and foundation models.
  - **3D & 4D Representations:** NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, 4D space-time, dynamic scene reconstruction.
  - **Geometric Priors:** Flexible shape priors, category-level pose estimation, deformables, and world models.
  - **Dense Prediction:** Semantic segmentation, depth estimation, optical flow (e.g., LiftUp), and intrinsic image decomposition.

  STRICT EXCLUSIONS (Do NOT select these):
  - **Applied Papers:** Papers that merely apply existing methods (like YOLO, ResNet, or standard Transformers) to niche fields without proposing a new *computer vision method*.
  - **Excluded Fields:** - Medical Imaging / Diagnostics (CT, MRI, X-Ray)
    - Traffic Control / Autonomous Driving Systems (unless focused on low-level perception/prediction)
    - Agriculture / Remote Sensing / Satellite Imagery
    - Sports Analytics
  - **High-Level Robotics:** End-to-End VLA / Manipulation policies (unless they introduce a novel visual representation).
